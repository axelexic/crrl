//! Architecture-specific implementations of finite fields.
//!
//! This module provides type aliases for the structures that implement
//! some finite fields. Each structure is specialized for a single field
//! (possibly through some type parameters, known at compile-time). There
//! can be several actual implementations for each type; a relevant
//! implementation is selected based on configured compilation features,
//! or through auto-detection of the current target.
//!
//! In general, the following properties apply to finite field implementations:
//!
//!  - An instance encapsulates a field element.
//!
//!  - The constant values `Self::ZERO` and `Self::ONE` contain the
//!    elements of value 0 and 1, respectively.
//!
//!  - Usual arithmetic operators can be used on field elements (`+`, `-`,
//!    `*`, `/`, and the compound assignments `+=`, `-=`, `*=` and `/=`).
//!    Division by zero is tolerated, and yields zero (regardless of the
//!    dividend). Operators can use both the raw types, and references
//!    thereof.
//!
//!  - Function `set_square(&mut self)` squares a field element (in place).
//!    Corresponding function `square(self) -> Self` returns the result
//!    as a new instance. These functions are somewhat faster than general
//!    multiplications. Sequences of multiple squarings can be performed
//!    with `set_xsquare(&mut self, n: u32)` (and a corresponding `xsquare()`
//!    to get the result as a new instance).
//!
//!  - Function `set_neg(&mut self)` negates the instance on which it is
//!    applied.
//!
//!  - Function `set_cond(&mut self, a: &Self, ctl: u32)` sets
//!    the instance to the value of the other instance `a` if `ctl` is
//!    equal to 0xFFFFFFFF, or leaves the instance value unmodified if
//!    `ctl` is equal to 0x00000000.
//!
//!  - Function `select(a0: &Self, a1: &Self, ctl: u32) -> Self` returns
//!    a copy of `a0` if `ctl` is 0x00000000, or a copy of `a1` if
//!    `ctl` is 0xFFFFFFFF.
//!
//!  - Function `cswap(a: &mut Self, b: &mut Self, ctl: u32)`
//!    exchanges the contents of `a` and `b` if `ctl` is 0xFFFFFFFF,
//!    or leaves them unmodified if `ctl` is 0x00000000.
//!
//!  - Functions `set_half()`, `set_mul2()`, `set_mul4()`, `set_mul8()`,
//!    `set_mul16()` and `set_mul32()`, all applied on `&mut self`,
//!    multiply their operand (in place) by 1/2, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32,
//!    respectively. Corresponding functions `half()`, `mul2()`, `mul4()`,
//!    `mul8()`, `mul16()` and `mul32()` operate on `self` and return
//!    a new instance. These functions are normally faster than a
//!    generic multiplication in the field.
//!
//!  - Some fields also provide `set_mul3()` (and `mul3()`) for
//!    multiplication by 3.
//!
//!  - Some fields also provide `set_mul_small(&mut self, x: u32)`
//!    (and `mul_small(self, x: 32) -> Self`) for multiplication by a
//!    small 32-bit integer provided at runtime.
//!
//!  - Constant values can be defined with the const-qualified `w64le()`
//!    and `w64be()` functions, which take the value as four 64-bit limbs
//!    in little-endian and big-endian order, respectively. The 256-bit
//!    value is implicitly reduced modulo the field order.
//!
//!  - Non-const functions `from_w64le()` and `from_w64be()` are also
//!    provided; they yield the same output as, but are potentially faster
//!    than, the const functions `w64le()` and `w64be()`. Note that
//!    both the const and the non-const functions are safe (they should
//!    have no side-channels); the non-const functions are nonetheless
//!    preferred at runtime.
//!
//!  - Conversions from `i32`, `u32`, `i64`, `u64`, `i128` ans `u128`
//!    can use the functions `from_i32()`, `from_u32()`, and so on.
//!
//!  - Function `equals(self, rhs: Self) -> u32` returns 0xFFFFFFFF
//!    if `self` and `rhs` represent the same value, or 0x00000000
//!    otherwise. Function `iszero(self) -> u32` is a specialized
//!    subcase that compares `self` with zero.
//!
//!  - The `legendre(self) -> i32` function returns the Legendre symbol
//!    for an element (0 for zero, +1 for non-zero squares, -1 for
//!    non-squares).
//!
//!  - The `batch_invert(xx: &mut[Self])` function performs inversion
//!    of all field elements in the provided slice. It works by
//!    combining internal elements in batches (normally of 200 elements)
//!    and mutualizing the internal inversion; this is vastly faster
//!    than inverting each element independently. Elements of value zero
//!    are tolerated (the "inverse" of zero is zero).
//!
//!  - The `set_sqrt(&mut self) -> u32` function computes the square root
//!    of an element. On success, 0xFFFFFFFF is returned. On failure (input
//!    is not a square), the element is set to zero, and 0x00000000 is
//!    returned. The chosen square root is the one whose least significant
//!    bit (when represented as an integer lower than the field order) is
//!    a zero. The non-in-place variant of this function is
//!    `sqrt(self) -> (Self, u32)`. Note that field implementations may
//!    not provide square root computations for all supported moduli.
//!
//!  - Function `split_vartime(self) -> (i128, i128)` returns two signed
//!    integers c0 and c1 such that `self` is equal to c0/c1. Note that
//!    if the field modulus is greater than about 1.73\*2^253, then
//!    the two values c0 and c1 may be truncated. In all generality,
//!    `self` is equal to `(c0 + a*2^128) / (c1 + b*2^128)` for two
//!    integers `a` and `b` such that:
//!
//!      - If the field modulus is at most 1.73\*2^253, then `a` and `b`
//!        are both 0 (the returned values are exact).
//!
//!      - If the field modulus is between 1.73\*2^253 and 1.73\*2^255,
//!        than `a` and `b` may range between -1 and +1 (inclusive).
//!
//!      - For larger moduli (up to 2^256), `a` and `b` may range between
//!        -2 and +2 (inclusive).
//!
//!    This function uses Lagrange's algorithm for lattice basis reduction
//!    in dimension 2. It is sufficiently fast to be considered for
//!    optimizing verification of Schnorr signatures. WARNING: this
//!    function is not constant-time; it MUST NOT be applied on secret
//!    data.
//!
//!  - Function `encode32(self) -> [u8; 32]` encodes an element as
//!    exactly 32 bytes. Unsigned little-endian convention is used.
//!    Encoding is always canonical (i.e. the encoding always uses
//!    the integer which is lower than the field modulus).
//!
//!  - Function `decode32(buf: &[u8]) -> (Self, u32)` decodes some bytes
//!    with little-endian convention. If the source slice does not have
//!    length exactly 32 bytes, then the decoding fails. If the source
//!    slice has length 32 bytes, but the byte contents yield a
//!    non-canonical value, then decoding fails. On success, the decoded
//!    value and 0xFFFFFFFF are returned; on failure, zero and 0x00000000
//!    are returned. If the source slice has length 32 bytes, then not
//!    only the decoded value, but also the operation outcome (success or
//!    failure), are shielded from side-channel leaks.
//!
//!  - Function `decode_reduce(buf: &[u8]) -> Self` decodes some bytes
//!    with unsigned little-endian convention. The obtained integer is
//!    reduced modulo the field order, so the process never fails.
//!    It is fully constant-time (only the length of the source slice
//!    may leak through timing-based side channels).
//!
//!  - Function `decode(buf: &[u8]) -> Option<Self>` decodes some bytes
//!    with unsigned little-endian convention. This function returns
//!    `None` if the source does not have exactly the minimal length
//!    that would be needed to encode the field modulus, or if the
//!    value is not in the proper range (i.e. lower than the modulus).
//!    Side-channels may leak whether decoding succeeded or failed, but
//!    not what value was obtained on success.
